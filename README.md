# Unofficial Slack WebApp for Ubuntu

## Note: This webapp not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Slack Technologies, Inc.

##  Description
[Slack] (https://slack.com) brings all your communication together in one place. It's real-time messaging, archiving and search for modern teams.

Currently Slack WebApp is only avaiable with Mac. We observed that when we open slack.com URL from  Google Chrome or Firefox it
consumes very much RAM and CPU of system. This webapp is coded in such way that, it opens Slack URL from integreted Unity
Web Browser which consumes very less RAM and CPU

## Supported Platforms:
This webapp is currently only support to Ubuntu 14.04

## Installation instructions:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gau1991/unity-webapps-slack-unofficial

1. Notifications are not yet integarted with Unity 
2. Notifications count is not yet visiabal on Unity Top bar
